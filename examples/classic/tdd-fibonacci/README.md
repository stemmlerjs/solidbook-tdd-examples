# Fibonacci

> The Fibonacci sequence is an interesting mathematical phenomenon. Starting from 0 and 1, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This means that the first ten numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. 

> Notice that the 2 can be found by adding the two numbers before it (1 + 1)? And notice that the 3 can be found by adding the two numbers before it as well (1 + 2)? Assuming indexes start at 0, write a function (or a class) that accepts any positive integer index and generates the Fibonacci number for that nth position. 

> Example: fibonacci(3) should return 2.
