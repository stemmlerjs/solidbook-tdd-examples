# Tic-tac toe

> X always goes first.
> Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board.
> Players cannot play on a played position.
> A player with three X’s or O’s in a row (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) wins.
> If all nine squares are filled and neither player achieves three in a row, the game is a draw.
