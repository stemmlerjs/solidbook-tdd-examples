# Password validator

Write a function (or a class) for validating passwords. Passwords must meet the following criteria:

- Between 5 and 15 characters long
- Contains at least one digit
- Contains at least one upper case letter

Return an object containing a boolean result and an errors key that — when provided with an invalid password — contains an error message for all errors in occurrence. There can be multiple errors at a single time.
