# Calculator Statistics

> Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers to determine the following statistics:

  - minimum value
  - maximum value
  - number of elements in the sequence
  - average value

For example: [6, 9, 15, -2, 92, 11]

  - minimum value = -2
  - maximum value = 92
  - number of elements in the sequence = 6
  - average value = 21.833333

> The difference with doing this exercise is that I should be starting from the assertion FIRST this time around.

- Arrange (Given)
- Act (When)
- **Assert (Then)**
